# Faller Car System Control Suite üöó

This project provides a software suite for controlling the Faller Car System, enabling complex and realistic traffic operations.

---

## Core Concepts

The system is built on a client-server architecture:

* **Central Server:** A **Raspberry Pi** acts as the brain of the operation. It manages the high-level logic, including traffic rules, vehicle routing, and overall system coordination.
* **Microcontrollers:** Affordable **ESP32** microcontrollers are used to control the physical components of the car system, such as traffic lights, roadway magnets, and other actuators.
* **Communication:** The **MQTT** protocol is used for lightweight and efficient messaging between the central server and the ESP32 clients.

## Features

* **Centralized Traffic Logic:** Implement custom traffic patterns and rules for sophisticated control.
* **Modular Hardware Control:** Easily expand the system by adding more ESP32-controlled elements.
* **Real-time Communication:** Low-latency communication ensures responsive and synchronized system behavior.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need:

1.  A **Raspberry Pi** (any model with network connectivity will suffice).
2.  One or more **ESP32** development boards.
3.  A running **MQTT broker**.
4.  The necessary hardware components for your Faller Car System layout.

(Further setup and installation instructions will be added here.)
